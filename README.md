- **To Educate on Digital Finances:** Introduce students to the basics of blockchain, digital currencies, and financial responsibility.
- **To Streamline Reward Systems:** Utilize smart contracts for efficient management and distribution of rewards, reducing administrative burdens.

## Features

- **Digital Tokens (LearnCoins):** A currency for rewards and transactions within the school's digital economy.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate reward distribution, enforce rules, and manage the token supply.
- **Educational Engagement:** Encourage a wide range of positive behaviors and academic achievements.
